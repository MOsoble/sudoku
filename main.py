#A standard Sudoku contains:
 #81 cells 
 #in a 9Ã—9 grid
 #and has 9 boxes
 #each box being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns. 
 #Each cell may contain a number from one to nine, and each number can only occur once in each row, column, and box. 
 #A Sudoku starts with some cells containing numbers (clues), and the goal is to solve the remaining cells.
